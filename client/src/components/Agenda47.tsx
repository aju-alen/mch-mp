            Funyula needs determined and visionary leadership at every level of its Wards to address the poverty and backwardness that pose threats to our very survival: Our poor-performing Educational Institutions, our non-functional Healthcare facilities, poorly maintained and neglected Infrastructure, rising unemployment, inadequate Water supply, constant Electricity blackouts, the Security of Samia, and much more.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base md:text-lg mb-8 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            To make clear that commitment, my proposal offers the Samia people the 2027 Future-Proof Funyula Platform to Make Funyula Constituency sustainable, and restore the fabric of the glorious Samia! It is a vision that begins with the following nine focus points that I will accomplish very quickly post the 2027 election win. I will collaborate with professionals from the community, respected elder statesmen and women of Samia, and both elected and appointed officials, including Permanent Secretaries (PSs), Principal Secretaries (PSs), Provincial Commissioners (PCs), Deputy County Commissioners (DCs), District Officers (DOs), Members of Parliament (MPs), Members of County Assembly (MCAs), Councillors, and Chiefs from the Constituency.
