      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;"><b>Funyula, July 18, 2025:</b> Incoming Member of Parliament for Funyula Constituency, Hon. Michael Mugenya, met with women traders from the Funyula main trading centre to discuss strategies for improving the local business environment. The meeting, held at the heart of Funyula’s trading hub, attracted a dozen women entrepreneurs eager to voice their concerns and aspirations.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">During the candid engagement, traders highlighted the pressing need for reliable electricity and water connections within the market. Many cited challenges in food preservation, security, and hygiene due to the lack of these essential services.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">Hon. Mugenya assured the women that their concerns would be a top priority in his development agenda. “For trade to flourish in Funyula, we must create an enabling environment. Reliable electricity will not only improve security but also open opportunities for modern business practices. Clean water is equally critical for health and sanitation, which our women traders require,” he said.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">Hon. Mugenya emphasised that improved infrastructure would spur economic growth, empower women traders, and enhance livelihoods across the constituency. “Investing in market utilities is an investment in our people, and the current government sees the need for this, with over 400+ modern market projects on-going,” he added.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">The meeting concluded with a shared commitment to work collaboratively towards these goals. The women pledged to support initiatives that will bring sustainable change to the community.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">Hon. Mugenya’s campaign has continued to focus on grassroots engagement, ensuring that local voices shape the constituency’s development priorities. As the 2027 elections draw closer, his pledge to modernise Funyula’s markets positions him as a champion for economic empowerment and inclusive growth.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">The initiative aligns with Mugenya’s broader agenda of grassroots empowerment and economic development as he seeks to transform Funyula into a hub of inclusive progress and restore the fabric of our glorious Samia.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;"><b>Funyula, July 18, 2025:</b> Incoming Member of Parliament for Funyula Constituency, Hon. Michael Mugenya, has taken a bold step to improve working conditions for boda boda operators by erecting sheltered rest areas in key stages in the constituency. The initiative aims to protect riders from harsh weather and enhance safety and convenience for both operators and passengers.
</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">Speaking at the unveiling of one of the newly erected shades, Hon. Mugenya emphasised the importance of boda boda operators in Funyula’s economy. “Boda boda riders are the lifeline of our transport sector. They move our goods, take our children to school, and connect communities. It’s only fair that we give them the dignity and working conditions they deserve, and I say this, having witnessed what progressive societies are doing to their people - the aim being to improve overall happiness,” he said.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">The newly constructed shelters provide riders with a shaded space to rest and wait for customers, reducing exposure to scorching sun and heavy rains. This innovation mirrors similar rider welfare programs seen in global cities like Dubai, though adapted to suit local needs and realities. Although the facilities do not currently have air conditioning, which will be introduced at a later date, they offer ample seating space, a roof cover, and a meeting point for riders and customers.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">Boda boda operators welcomed the move, calling it a “game-changer” for their daily operations. “This shade means a lot to us. We can now wait for customers without worrying about the weather,” said Gilton Lusate, one rider at the launch.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">Hon. Mugenya reiterated his commitment to expanding the program across all major stages in Funyula Constituency. “This is just the beginning. Our goal is to make the boda boda sector more organised, safer, and more comfortable for everyone,” he added.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">The initiative aligns with Mugenya’s broader agenda of grassroots empowerment and economic development as he seeks to transform Funyula into a hub of inclusive progress and restore the fabric of our glorious Samia.</p>
