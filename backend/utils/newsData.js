      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;"><b>Funyula, July 18, 2025:</b> Incoming Member of Parliament for Funyula Constituency, Hon. Michael Mugenya, met with women traders from the Funyula main trading centre to discuss strategies for improving the local business environment. The meeting, held at the heart of Funyula's trading hub, attracted a dozen women entrepreneurs eager to voice their concerns and aspirations.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">During the candid engagement, traders highlighted the pressing need for reliable electricity and water connections within the market. Many cited challenges in food preservation, security, and hygiene due to the lack of these essential services.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">Hon. Mugenya assured the women that their concerns would be a top priority in his development agenda. "For trade to flourish in Funyula, we must create an enabling environment. Reliable electricity will not only improve security but also open opportunities for modern business practices. Clean water is equally critical for health and sanitation, which our women traders require," he said.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">Hon. Mugenya emphasised that improved infrastructure would spur economic growth, empower women traders, and enhance livelihoods across the constituency. "Investing in market utilities is an investment in our people, and the current government sees the need for this, with over 400+ modern market projects on-going," he added.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">The meeting concluded with a shared commitment to work collaboratively towards these goals. The women pledged to support initiatives that will bring sustainable change to the community.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">Hon. Mugenya's campaign has continued to focus on grassroots engagement, ensuring that local voices shape the constituency's development priorities. As the 2027 elections draw closer, his pledge to modernise Funyula's markets positions him as a champion for economic empowerment and inclusive growth.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">The initiative aligns with Mugenya's broader agenda of grassroots empowerment and economic development as he seeks to transform Funyula into a hub of inclusive progress and restore the fabric of our glorious Samia.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;"><b>Funyula, July 18, 2025:</b> Incoming Member of Parliament for Funyula Constituency, Hon. Michael Mugenya, has taken a bold step to improve working conditions for boda boda operators by erecting sheltered rest areas in key stages in the constituency. The initiative aims to protect riders from harsh weather and enhance safety and convenience for both operators and passengers.
</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">Speaking at the unveiling of one of the newly erected shades, Hon. Mugenya emphasised the importance of boda boda operators in Funyula's economy. "Boda boda riders are the lifeline of our transport sector. They move our goods, take our children to school, and connect communities. It's only fair that we give them the dignity and working conditions they deserve, and I say this, having witnessed what progressive societies are doing to their people - the aim being to improve overall happiness," he said.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">The newly constructed shelters provide riders with a shaded space to rest and wait for customers, reducing exposure to scorching sun and heavy rains. This innovation mirrors similar rider welfare programs seen in global cities like Dubai, though adapted to suit local needs and realities. Although the facilities do not currently have air conditioning, which will be introduced at a later date, they offer ample seating space, a roof cover, and a meeting point for riders and customers.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">Boda boda operators welcomed the move, calling it a "game-changer" for their daily operations. "This shade means a lot to us. We can now wait for customers without worrying about the weather," said Gilton Lusate, one rider at the launch.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">Hon. Mugenya reiterated his commitment to expanding the program across all major stages in Funyula Constituency. "This is just the beginning. Our goal is to make the boda boda sector more organised, safer, and more comfortable for everyone," he added.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">The initiative aligns with Mugenya's broader agenda of grassroots empowerment and economic development as he seeks to transform Funyula into a hub of inclusive progress and restore the fabric of our glorious Samia.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;"><b>Nairobi, Kenya | January 13, 2026:</b></p>
      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">A high-level strategic brainstorming, mentorship, and advisory meeting held yesterday at the Bomas of Kenya has sparked fresh optimism for the future of Funyula Constituency and the wider Samia community. The meeting brought together the Chief Executive Officer of the Bomas of Kenya, Mr. Jimmy Okidiangi, and Hon. Michael Mugenya, the incoming and aspiring Member of Parliament for Funyula Constituency.
</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">Captured against the backdrop of national and cultural flags at the iconic Bomas of Kenya, the engagement symbolized a convergence of culture, leadership, and forward-thinking governance. Mr. Okidiangi, as CEO of one of Kenya&apos;s most important cultural and conferencing institutions, holds a unique vantage point on national development, public policy engagement, cultural preservation, and stakeholder coordination. His experience in managing a national institution that bridges culture, tourism, and governance made his counsel particularly valuable.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">For Hon. Michael Mugenya, the meeting was a deliberate step in grounding his leadership journey in mentorship, strategic thinking, and community-centered collaboration. As he prepares to vie for the Funyula parliamentary seat, Mugenya emphasized the importance of learning from seasoned leaders and technocrats from the Samia community who have successfully navigated national responsibilities while remaining rooted in community values.</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">Discussions during the session reportedly focused on leadership ethics, inclusive development, youth empowerment, cultural identity, and how Funyula can better leverage its human capital for socio-economic transformation. Central to the dialogue was the need to "restore the fabric of the great Samia community" by reconnecting leadership with culture, shared values, and collective responsibility.</p>

   <p style="font-size:1.25rem;">
  Mugenya&apos;s intention to pursue collaborative leadership: one that draws wisdom from accomplished professionals, institutions, and elders to craft sustainable solutions for Funyula. By engaging minds such as Mr. Okidiangi&apos;s, Mugenya signaled a leadership style anchored in consultation, mentorship, and long-term vision.
</p>

      <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">As Funyula looks toward the future, this strategic engagement stands out as an early indicator of purposeful leadership aimed at prosperity, unity, and cultural pride for the Samia people.</p>

    <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">As Kenya steadily inches toward the 2027 General Election, political actors across the country are recalibrating their strategies, with a growing emphasis on development-driven leadership over populist sloganeering. In Busia County, this shift was evident during a high-level consultative meeting between aspiring Funyula Member of Parliament, <b>Hon. Michael Mugenya</b>, and his mentor, seasoned legislator and Busia County Member of the National Assembly, <b>Hon. Geoffrey Mulanya</b>.</p>

    <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">The meeting, captured in a symbolic photo that reflects both mentorship and generational continuity in leadership, brought together experience and ambition at a critical moment in the county&apos;s political journey. Hon. Mulanya, widely credited with redefining politics in Busia through a results-oriented approach, has long stood out for prioritizing tangible development outcomes over partisan rhetoric: a model that has earned him enduring grassroots support.</p>

    <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">Discussions between the two leaders centered on leveraging elective office to accelerate constituency-level development. Key among the strategies explored was the use of parliamentary influence to unlock funding for transformative projects through partnerships with established institutions such as <b>Safaricom Foundation</b> and the <b>Center for Innovation and Development</b>. Such collaborations, they noted, remain critical in bridging development gaps, particularly in underserved rural communities.</p>

    <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">Hon. Mulanya also offered strategic counsel to Hon. Mugenya as he positions himself for the 2027 electoral contest. The advice emphasized people-centered leadership, consistent community engagement, and the importance of aligning political ambition with the everyday needs of constituents. For Mugenya, the guidance reinforces a campaign philosophy anchored in service delivery rather than short-term political theatrics.</p>

    <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">Beyond the election, the meeting explored avenues for future collaboration between the two leaders for the benefit of the wider <b>Samia and Nambale</b> regions. Proposed initiatives include <b>solarized water projects, SME empowerment programs</b, and <b>youth training and skills development</b>, all aimed at fostering sustainable economic growth and resilience at the grassroots.</p>

    <p style=" font-size:1.25rem;">As the 2027 electioneering period gradually takes shape, such consultative engagements signal a maturing political culture in Busia: one where leadership is increasingly measured not by rhetoric, but by vision, partnerships, and measurable impact on people&apos;s lives.</p>
